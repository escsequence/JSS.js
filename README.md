# JSS.js
JSS.js - JSON Style Sheet based in JavaScript - Currently a work in progress (requires jQuery), but works!

Currently JSS.js is using jQuery, and cssJson.js (https://github.com/aramk/CSSJSON) library to perform it's conversion methods - this JavaScript library also requires the use of a server (local or on the internets).

Main goal is maximize functionality of JSON based style sheets, secondary goal is to minimize / remove the need for jQuery and the other libraries for simplicity and ease of use.
